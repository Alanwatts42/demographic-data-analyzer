This project is part of a FreeCodeCamp course called *Data Analysis with Python*. FreeCodeCamp provided a github repository containing the boilerplate original verision of this project. This repository is my forked version of that boilerplate repository, which I used to complete the project per the instructions included in both the comments on demographic-data-analyzer.py, and at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer

<br>

After modifying the *demographic)_data_analyzer.py* file according to the instructions for this project, I was able to get this project to pass all included unit tests. I am therefore submitting this version as my completed version of this project for FreeCodeCamp for evaluation, which will hopefully allow me to complete this Python course.
